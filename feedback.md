# Project 2 Evaluation

Please review [inline code comments](https://github.com/Robizzy27/project2/compare/master...nolds9:feedback) prefixed with my initials `NHO`.

## Technical Requirements

> The app contains at least 2 models, with at least 1 association. At least 1 model is full CRUD.

Great job incorporating many models.

## Creativity and Interface

> The app displays a personal spin or creative element through its written language, functionality, purpose, and/or CSS. Submission includes proof of HTML / CSS validation

Loved the Westorosi theme and feel of this application.

## Code Quality

> Code lacks proper formatting, includes commented out, non-functional code, or otherwise contains major issues of quality (DRY, naming, etc)

Looks like you have some code that is not being used (Users). Would recommend leaving that on a feature branch so you can implement that later.

## Deployment and Functionality

> Application is not deployed, and contains minimal functionality

No evidence of deployment. App is functional locally.

## Planning / Process / Submission

> App is submitted, with basic evidence of planning. Documentation exists, but lacks common areas such as setup instructions, description of application functionality and link to deployed application

Make sure to include a `README` with appropriate documentation, and it would be helpful to move your wireframes / erds to a `planning` directory.
